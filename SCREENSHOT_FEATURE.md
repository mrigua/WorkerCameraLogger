# Screenshot Feature Guide

The Multi-Camera Control application now includes a powerful screenshot capability with customizable save locations. This feature allows you to quickly capture the application state for documentation, troubleshooting, or sharing with others.

## Taking Screenshots

1. Click the **Screenshot** button in the toolbar to instantly capture the current application window.
2. A notification will appear confirming the screenshot was saved, along with its location.
3. The status bar will also display the save path of the captured screenshot.

## Configuring Screenshot Settings

The screenshot tool allows you to customize where screenshots are saved:

1. Click the dropdown arrow next to the **Screenshot** button.
2. Select **Configure Screenshot Settings...** from the menu.
3. In the dialog, you can:
   - Select the active save location from the dropdown.
   - Add new save locations.

## Default Save Locations

The screenshot feature comes with several pre-configured save locations:

- **Default**: Standard save location in your Pictures folder.
- **Configuration**: Folder for configuration-related screenshots.
- **Error Logs**: Folder for error-related screenshots.
- **Replit**: Main Replit screenshots directory.

## File Naming

Screenshots are automatically named with the following format:
```
[prefix]_screenshot_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.png
```

Where:
- `[prefix]` is the current filename prefix (if any).
- `YYYYMMDD` is the current date.
- `HHMMSS` is the current time.

## Tips

- Use the filename prefix to easily identify related screenshots.
