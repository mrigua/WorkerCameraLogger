# Multi-Camera Controller - Supported Formats

This document provides information about the image formats supported by the Multi-Camera Controller system.

## Supported Format Categories

The Multi-Camera Controller supports a wide range of image formats, organized into the following categories:

### RAW Formats
RAW formats contain minimally processed data from the camera's image sensor. They provide the highest quality and most flexibility for post-processing.

- `.arw` - Sony RAW
- `.cr2` - Canon RAW v2
- `.cr3` - Canon RAW v3
- `.crw` - Canon RAW
- `.dng` - Digital Negative (Adobe's universal RAW format)
- `.erf` - Epson RAW
- `.nef` - Nikon RAW
- `.orf` - Olympus RAW
- `.pef` - Pentax RAW
- `.raf` - Fujifilm RAW
- `.raw` - Generic RAW
- `.rw2` - Panasonic RAW
- `.srw` - Samsung RAW

### JPEG Formats
JPEG is a compressed image format that offers smaller file sizes at the cost of some image quality.

- `.jpg` - JPEG
- `.jpeg` - JPEG
- `.jpe` - JPEG
- `.jif` - JPEG
- `.jfif` - JPEG

### TIFF Formats
TIFF is a flexible, high-quality format that supports lossless compression.

- `.tif` - TIFF
- `.tiff` - TIFF

### PNG Formats
PNG is a lossless compressed format that supports transparency.

- `.png` - PNG

### GIF Formats
GIF supports animation and is commonly used for simple graphics.

- `.gif` - GIF

### Other Formats
Additional formats that may be supported by some cameras:

- `.bmp` - Bitmap
- `.webp` - WebP
- `.ico` - Icon
- `.psd` - Adobe Photoshop
- `.heic` - High Efficiency Image Format
- `.heif` - High Efficiency Image Format

## Format Support by Camera Type

### Real Cameras (via gphoto2)
The format support for real cameras depends on the specific camera model. Most DSLRs and mirrorless cameras support multiple formats, including RAW and JPEG.

### Mock Cameras
The mock camera system (used for testing) only supports JPEG format.

## Format Preferences

The Multi-Camera Controller allows you to set format preferences in the GUI:

1. **Keep All Formats**: This is the default setting. The system will download all formats produced by the camera.

2. **Prefer RAW**: When available, the system will prioritize RAW formats.

3. **Prefer JPEG**: When available, the system will prioritize JPEG formats.

Some cameras can be configured to capture in multiple formats simultaneously (e.g., RAW+JPEG). The format preference setting helps you manage these multi-format captures.

## File Organization

The Multi-Camera Controller can organize captured images by format type:

1. **Format Subdirectories**: When enabled, the system will create subdirectories for each format category (RAW, JPEG, etc.) and place files in the appropriate directory.

2. **Date-Based Organization**: Files are always organized by date using the pattern specified in the capture settings.

## Format Detection

The system automatically detects file formats based on file extensions. This information is displayed in the capture results log and can be used for filtering or processing images.

## Limitations

1. **Format Conversion**: The current version does not include format conversion capabilities. Files are saved in their original format as provided by the camera.

2. **Mock Camera Limitations**: Mock cameras can only generate JPEG test images.

3. **Camera Configuration**: Not all cameras allow remote configuration of their output format. In some cases, you will need to set the format directly on the camera.

## Future Improvements

Planned format-related improvements include:

1. **Format Conversion**: Adding the ability to convert between formats (e.g., RAW to JPEG) during or after download.

2. **Format Filtering**: Adding filters to show only specific formats in the UI.

3. **Format Metadata**: Enhanced display of format-specific metadata (bit depth, compression ratio, etc.).

4. **Format Profiles**: Creating custom format profiles for different shooting scenarios.
